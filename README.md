# StockPricePrediction
This project is entirely for educational purposes.

Here, we are trying to predict a stock's adjusted closing price using a stacked LSTM Model. An LSTM Model keeps the old data and uses it for prediction which is required for predicting stock prices since they also depend on the previous prices. Here, firstly, a stock's data is downloaded from yfinance. It is preprocessed and the model is trained accordingly and then predictions are made.
